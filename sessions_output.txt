  prompts:
  - With reference to Simple Sender Module Refactoring Brief assess the src/simple_sender/config.py. Briefly describe its purpose and how it fits into the overall project, the major functions or classes it contains. Do not refactor yet—just return your assessment.
  - Based on your assessment, propose a detailed refactoring plan for src/simple_sender/config.py. Include specific improvements such as function extraction, renaming, logic simplification, or restructuring; explain how these changes improve maintainability or readability; and note any dependencies or potential side effects. Wait for my approval before proceeding.
  - Apply the refactor to src/simple_sender/config.py. Output the complete refactored code in one block with minimal inline comments where necessary to explain any non-obvious changes. Do not modify other files or make assumptions about external dependencies unless instructed.
